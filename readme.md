# HELLO!

I hope you are having a great day cause I am not.
Regardless, if you want to run this its pretty simple:
- Install python (>3.8)
- Install pip dependencies 
- Run!

## IMPORTANT NOTE
Do not try to attempt to understand the javascript, please read the paper linked at the site as it will explain it much better. The javascript code is not clear but rather a big equation.

# Enjoy,
Space Potatoes
